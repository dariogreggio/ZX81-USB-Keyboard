# ZX81-USB-Keyboard
using an USB keyboard on your old ZX81!

Uses a Microchip PIC24FJ64GB002 and standard USB stack (pre-@Â£$%#-harmony) 2.0, from 2014-2017

13 pins get connected to the ZX81 main board in place of membrane keyboard (pins are described in code)

Basically nothing else is needed apart from 3.3V regulator and the PIC itself (not even a crystal!)
